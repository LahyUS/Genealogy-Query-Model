# Genealogy Query Model

Genealogy Query Model is a project built using Python and Prolog (specifically, SWI-Prolog). It implements a first-order logic model based on the foundation of forward chaining and backward chaining algorithms. This model is designed for answering or querying relationships in genealogy.
